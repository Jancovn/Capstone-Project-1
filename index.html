    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <img src="/personal.jpeg" width="200"  alt="personal photo"/>
    <p>
This is my personalised resume that I am building using all of the skills that I am learning. <br>
I am studying web development online. I have a passion for technology and am truly fascinated by how
it functions.<br> I do not have enough money or funding to go to a university, so my second-best option
is to learn online and teach myself.<br> My goal is to build up enough experience and projects to land my first
job in web development!<br> This web page is a summary of all my experience and qualifications that I have.
    </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
<h3>High School</h3>
    <p>I completed high school with a 70% average. </p>
    <p>The subjects I took were: 
        <ul>
<li>Math literacy</li>
<li>English second language</li>
<li>Afrikaans</li>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>Computer application technology</li>
<li>Business studies</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Yachting career</h3>
    <p>After high school I immediately started with all of my yachting qualifications
        to become a deckhand/junior engineer. At the time I did not know that I hated the yachting industry.
        Only after spending all of my university study money on yachting courses and getting a taste for the industry
        I realised that it is not for me. I am currently still looking for work on yachts so I can make some
        off the money I spent on courses back.<b> I am in a lot of debt at the moment</b>. However, this is also giving me
        the opportunity while I wait for work to focus on my long-term career, web development. I am not letting life
        get in the way of chasing my dreams anymore, hence the reason I am creating this. I am now on a self
        study journey to learning and becoming one of the best full-stack web developers out there.
